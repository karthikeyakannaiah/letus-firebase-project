This is a personal learning project of mine
I wanted to utilize and learn firebase and develop web applications
If you are seeing this 

letus is a personal social platform type web app, whatever, 
to be honest I can't define it perfectly lol
where you can post things to youself and also to public and have a profile 
pretty basic things or feature in social network platforms

I am exploring web dev currently, there is a lot still to cover
Doing Learning projects are way to understand and study and develop yourself
